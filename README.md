## Sound values

``` r
dur_hablo_stressed = 437.687
dur_hablo_unstressed = 375.161
dur_o_stressed = 137.559
dur_o_unstressed = 106.295
int_o_stressed = 75.485
int_o_unstressed = 76.126
f0_o_stressed = 150.42
f0_o_unstressed = 166.186
```

## Differences

``` r
dur_hablo_stressed - dur_hablo_unstressed #in miliseconds
```

    ## [1] 62.526

``` r
dur_o_stressed - dur_o_unstressed #in miliseconds
```

    ## [1] 31.264

``` r
int_o_unstressed - int_o_stressed #in decibels
```

    ## [1] 0.641

``` r
f0_o_unstressed - f0_o_stressed # in Hertz
```

    ## [1] 15.766

I have recorded the above values for the duration of each component. I
am surprised that the total duration of the word “habló” in preterit
form was shorter than “hablo” in the present simple, although the
stressed vowel was longer than the unstressed vowel. Note that duration
is reported in miliseconds (ms), intensity is represented in decibels
(dB), f0 (pitch) measurements as Hertz (Hz).
